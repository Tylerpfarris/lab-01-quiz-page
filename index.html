                    Mezcal (/mɛˈskæl/, Spanish: [mesˈkal] (About this soundlisten)) is a distilled alcoholic beverage
                    made from any type of
                    agave. The word mezcal comes from Nahuatl mexcalli [meʃˈkalːi], which means "oven-cooked agave",
                    from metl [met͡ɬ] and
                    ixcalli [iʃˈkalːi].[1]

                    Agaves or magueys are found mainly in many parts of Mexico and south to the equator, though most
                    mezcal is made in
                    Oaxaca.[2] It can also be made in Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas,
                    Zacatecas, Michoacan, and
                    the recently approved Puebla.[3] A saying attributed to Oaxaca regarding the drink is: "Para todo
                    mal, mezcal, y para
                    todo bien, también." ("For everything bad, mezcal, and for everything good, as well.").[4][5]

                    Whether distilled drinks were produced in Mexico before the Spanish Conquest is unknown.[6] The
                    Spaniards were
                    introduced to native fermented drinks such as pulque, made from the maguey plant. Soon, the
                    conquistadors began
                    experimenting with the agave plant to find a way to make a distillable fermented mash. The result
                    was mezcal.[7]

                    Today, mezcal is still made from the heart of the agave plant, called the piña, in much the same way
                    as it was 200 years
                    ago.[4][8] In Mexico, mezcal is generally consumed straight and has a strong smoky flavor.[8] Though
                    other types of
                    mezcal are not as popular as tequila (made specifically from the blue agave in select regions of the
                    country), Mexico
                    does export the product, mostly to Japan and the United States, and exports are growing.[9][10]

                    Despite the similar name, mezcal does not contain mescaline or other psychedelic substances.[11]
