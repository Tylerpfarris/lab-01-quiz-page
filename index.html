                Some facts about Mezcal!
            </h2>

            <content>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Mezcal (/mɛˈskæl/, Spanish: [mesˈkal] is a distilled alcoholic beverage
                    made from any type of agave. The word mezcal comes from Nahuatl mexcalli [meʃˈkalːi], which means
                    "oven-cooked agave",
                    from metl [met͡ɬ] and ixcalli [iʃˈkalːi].<br>

                    <br>Agaves or magueys are found mainly in many parts of Mexico and south to the equator, though most
                    mezcal is made in
                    Oaxaca. It can also be made in Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas,
                    Zacatecas, Michoacan, and the recently approved Puebla. A saying attributed to Oaxaca regarding the
                    drink is: "Para todo mal, mezcal, y para
                    todo bien, también." ("For everything bad, mezcal, and for everything good, as well.").

                <br>
                <p>Whether distilled drinks were produced in Mexico before the Spanish Conquest is unknown. The
                    Spaniards were introduced to native fermented drinks such as pulque, made from the maguey plant.
                    Soon, the conquistadors began experimenting with the agave plant to find a way to make a distillable
                    fermented mash. The result was mezcal.<br>

                    <br>Today, mezcal is still made from the heart of the agave plant, called the piña, in much the same
                    way
                    as it was 200 years ago. In Mexico, mezcal is generally consumed straight and has a strong smoky
                    flavor.Though other types of mezcal are not as popular as tequila (made specifically from the blue
                    agave in select regions of the country), Mexico does export the product, mostly to Japan and the
                    United States, and exports are growing.<br>

                    <br>Despite the similar name, mezcal does not contain mescaline or other psychedelic substances.
